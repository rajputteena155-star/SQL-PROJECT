🎉 Just completed a hands-on SQL project!

I built databases for retail sales and employee management, where I:

Designed normalized tables for customers, sales, employees, attendance, and salaries.

Used joins, aggregates, and grouping to analyze sales trends and employee performance.

Performed data manipulation with INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

Managed transactions and commits to ensure data consistency.

Applied filters and conditional queries to extract meaningful insights.

This project gave me practical experience in real-world data management and strengthened my SQL and relational database skills.
