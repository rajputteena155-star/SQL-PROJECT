SQL PROJECT
Project Focus: Relational Data Modeling, SQL Queries, and Transaction Management
1. Introduction
These projects focused on designing and managing relational databases using SQL. The goal was to simulate real-world business scenarios (sales management for a retail system and employee management for an organization). I applied relational data modeling, complex queries, aggregate functions, joins, updates, and transaction handling to demonstrate practical SQL proficiency.
2. Project Objectives
Design normalized relational databases to manage structured data efficiently.
Perform data manipulation using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
Retrieve and analyze data using joins, aggregate functions, and grouping.
Maintain data integrity with transactions and commit operations.
Apply practical SQL techniques to real-world datasets for reporting and analysis.
3. Database Design and Modeling
3.1 Unicorn Sales Database
Created a sales management system with a table for sales (UNICORN_SALES) and a table for customer details (CUSTOMER_INFO).
Implemented one-to-many and many-to-many relationships by linking customers to sales records.
Applied grouping and aggregate functions to summarize sales per region, per customer, and per product.
Performed table alterations to rename tables and modify structure dynamically.
Conducted transaction operations to update records safely while maintaining data consistency.


3.2 Employee Records Database
Created employee management system with tables for employee information, attendance, and salary.
Normalized the database to store employee details, attendance tracking, and salary records separately.
Applied filters, pattern matching, and conditional queries to extract employee performance, absences, and salary information.
Used aggregate functions and grouping to calculate total salaries per month and summarize employee attendance.
Performed updates and ordering operations to manage employee salaries and department data efficiently.


4. SQL Techniques Demonstrated
Joins:
Combined sales and customer data to generate detailed reports.
Linked employee attendance with salary data for performance analysis.
Used INNER, LEFT, RIGHT joins and unions to extract comprehensive insights.


Aggregate Functions and Grouping:
Summed quantities and salaries.
Counted records per region, product, or employee performance category.
Calculated averages to analyze trends, such as average quantity per product or average salary.


Data Manipulation:
Added new sales, customers, employees, and salary records.
Updated existing records to reflect changes in quantity, salary, and attendance.


Transactions and Commit:
Used transaction blocks to ensure safe updates and prevent data inconsistency.
Demonstrated commit operations after successful updates to finalize changes.


Filtering and Conditional Queries:
Applied WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, NOT IN, and LIKE conditions for advanced data retrieval.
Filtered high-value sales, specific employee performance categories, and departmental records.


Database Management:
Created multiple databases and tables.
Renamed tables and columns to reflect changing requirements.
Ensured structured and normalized storage of data for efficiency and scalability.




5. Conclusion 
Through these projects, I developed hands-on expertise in designing relational databases, writing advanced SQL queries, performing data analysis, and ensuring transactional integrity. The exercises demonstrated my ability to:
Handle real-world business and organizational data.
Apply SQL best practices for structured querying and reporting.
Use joins, aggregations, and transactions effectively for data management and decision-making.


These projects strengthened my practical understanding of SQL and relational database concepts, preparing me for more complex data management and analytics tasks.
